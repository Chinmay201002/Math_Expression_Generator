# Math_Expression_Generator
In this project,we can generate random expressions and calculate its answers using eval(evaluate) built in function of python.
After that we can take answer from the user and compare it with evaluate answer.
If both are same then we proceed for next expression else same expression will appear.
After that we can measure start time and end time using time library and time function of it.
From that we can get the total time required to solve the all the expressions in seconds.
